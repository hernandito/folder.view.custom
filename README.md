# Folder.View UI Customizations

Custom Folder.View GUI modifications to the amazing Folder.View plugin for unRAID by scolcipitato.

Special thanks to scolpitato for creating and continuing with the Docker page modification that groups your Docker icons into custom folders of your choosing. This plugin makes the Docker GUI page less cluttered and more organized. He has been very helpful in accommodating changes to his code to allow individuals to make the customizations.

To implemet a customization, you must have the Folder.View plugin installed in your unRAID server. Simply copy the appropriate "docker-custom.css" file into your Flash drive's **/boot/config/plugins/folder.view/styles** folder.  


This is simply wrapping the source in a runnable Docker image for everyone that cannot install the dev environment on his machine or everyone that wants a simple containerized solution.
