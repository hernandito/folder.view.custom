# Compact View

Compact view that allows you to fit a large number of Dockers in a single folder.

- Changes include eliminating the status copy in the folder preview. Status can be easily recongize by the icon. 
- Stopped container color changed to orange to make is less visually strong.
- Highlighted the Folder Name to give the folder hierarchy.
- Provided background colors to visually organize both the Folder Names and the Previews.
- Removed WebUI links and Log links when containers are stopped in List View. These links wouldn't work on a stopped container.
- Tightened spaces throughout to make for a compact layout. Great when browsing on a tablet.
